This repository demonstrates a common error in DApps: inaccurate wallet connection checks. The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to check for a connected wallet but lacks robust error handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and more reliable connection status determination. This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in building reliable decentralized applications.
